# Inventory Control System

The Inventory Control System is a robust application designed to streamline the management of inventory items. Each item in the inventory is defined by attributes such as an identifier, description, quantity, and measure unit. This system allows users to create new items, edit existing items, and delete items, all while ensuring error-free data input.
